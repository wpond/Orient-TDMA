* optimal tx period for packet loss due to extended periods transmitting
* 1 node 1 slot - throughput
* 1 node max slots - throughput
* 2 nodes max slots - throughput
* 1 node systematic loss - throughput
* 2 nodes systematic loss - throughput
* 5 nodes systematic loss - throughput
* systematic loss with max frame size enabled - throughput

# running
tx period
throughput, improved
more nodes
rates of data generation
different payload sizes (wasted space)



* store queue and sent for last frame
** if queued >= sent, request slot
** if sucessful sent << sent, maxframesize = sucessful sent * 2 else maxframesize = 0 (infinite)
