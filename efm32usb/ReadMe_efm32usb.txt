================ EFM32 USB STACK ============================================

This directory, "efm32usb", contains the Energy Micro USB stack library for 
the EFM32 Giant Gecko and Leopard Gecko series of microcontrollers.

Some design guidelines for this library is:

* Follow the guidelines established by ARM's and Energy Micro's adaptation 
  of the CMSIS (see below) standard

* Be usable as a starting point for developing richer, more target specific 
  functionality (i.e. copy and modify further)

* Ability to be used as a standalone software component, used by other drivers
  that should cover "the most common cases"

* Readability of the code and usability preferred before optimization for speed
  and size or covering a particular "narrow" purpose

* As little "cross-dependency" between modules as possible, to enable users to
  pick and choose what they want

================ About CMSIS ================================================

The USB APIs are built on top of EFM32_CMSIS headers and efm32lib APIS, which 
again are based on the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard. 
These files are supplied together with this archive in separate folders.

The library requires basic C99-support. You might have to enable C99 support 
in your compiler. Comments are in doxygen compatible format, and can be viewed
online from Energy Micro's web site.
